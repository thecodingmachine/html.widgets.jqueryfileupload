	# .htaccess RewriteBase related tips courtesy of Symfony 2's skeleton app.

    # Determine the RewriteBase automatically and set it as environment variable.
    # If you are using Apache aliases to do mass virtual hosting or installed the
    # project in a subdirectory, the base path will be prepended to allow proper
    # resolution of the base directory and to redirect to the correct URI. It will
    # work in environments without path prefix as well, providing a safe, one-size
    # fits all solution. But as you do not need it in this case, you can comment
    # the following 2 lines to eliminate the overhead.
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}::$1 ^(/.+)/(.*)::\2$
    RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=BASE:%1]

	RewriteRule (^upload.php) - [L]

    # Rewrite all other queries to the front controller.
    #RewriteRule .? %{ENV:BASE}/upload.php [L]
